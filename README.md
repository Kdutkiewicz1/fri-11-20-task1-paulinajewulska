## Task 1

The main problem was to create a program that represents a bank. The program was supposed to add new clients, add cash to their accounts and transfer money between clients.

During this class I have learned how to properly use dictionary. Using it instead of list made my code more concise, readable, convenient and faster. To be able to use class Client as a key I learned I need to add __eq__ and __hash__ function. Moreover, I realised that _if name == "main"_ is significant and printing information to user should not be overused in functions. Also I have broadened my knowledge about PEP8.
